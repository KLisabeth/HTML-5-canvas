> Studying this project we learned about:

* How we can set it's inner size.
* How to assign round corners of the drown line.( can also use **bevel** for beveled corners or **miter** for sharp corners)
* What is HSL (H- stands for colors of the rainbow from 0red to 350red, S- saturation and L- is for lightness)
* How use HSL in our code.
* We understood some thing about events and when they happen. (when we move a mouse we use the event information on draw on our canvas)

> This code was well organized with `development-strategy`!
